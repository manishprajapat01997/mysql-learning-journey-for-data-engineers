# Welcome to my 20-day MySQL learning journey! üöÄ  
This roadmap is designed to build a strong SQL foundation focused on **Data Engineering** and **Data Analytics** roles ‚Äî moving from basics to real-world applications with a hands-on project-based approach.

---

## üìÖ Roadmap Overview

### ‚úÖ **Day 1: Introduction & Basics of MySQL**
- Topics: Installing MySQL, basic SQL queries, data types  
- Practice:
  - Create a database and a simple table (e.g., customers)
  - Insert a few rows and query them using `SELECT` and `WHERE`

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 2: Filtering, Sorting, Aggregations**
- Topics: `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`  
- Practice:
  - Query sales data, find total sales by region
  - Filter sales greater than a threshold

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 3: Joins & Relationships**
- Topics: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`  
- Practice:
  - Join orders with customers on `customer_id`
  - List all customers and their orders (including those without orders)

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 4: Subqueries & Set Operations**
- Topics: Nested queries, `UNION`, `UNION ALL`  
- Practice:
  - Find customers who placed orders above average amount
  - Combine two result sets with `UNION`

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 5: Window Functions**
- Topics: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `NTILE()`  
- Practice:
  - Rank customers by total purchase amount
  - Calculate running totals of sales by date

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 6: Data Modeling & Schema Design**
- Topics: Normalization, denormalization, indexing  
- Practice:
  - Normalize a flat sales table into customers, orders, products
  - Create indexes on frequently filtered columns

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 7: Data Manipulation & ETL Basics**
- Topics: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, transactions, bulk load  
- Practice:
  - Load CSV data into MySQL using `LOAD DATA INFILE`
  - Write transaction to update order status safely

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 8: Views, Stored Procedures, Functions**
- Topics: Creating views, procedures, and user functions  
- Practice:
  - Create a view to simplify complex joins
  - Write a stored procedure to insert new customers with validation

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 9: Performance Tuning & Query Optimization**
- Topics: `EXPLAIN` plan, indexing, partitioning basics  
- Practice:
  - Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze slow queries
  - Add indexes and compare performance

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 10: Working with Time-Series & JSON Data**
- Topics: Date functions, JSON data type  
- Practice:
  - Extract year and month from order dates
  - Store and query JSON metadata for orders

---

## üîÑ Real-World + Advanced

### ‚úÖ **Day 11: Backup, Restore & Security Basics**
- Topics: Backup strategies, user permissions  
- Practice:
  - Take a logical backup with `mysqldump`
  - Create a restricted user for analytics only

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 12: Connecting MySQL with Data Tools**
- Topics: Python integration, Airflow, BI tools  
- Practice:
  - Query MySQL using Python (`pandas + mysql-connector`)
  - Create a simple Airflow DAG to run a SQL extraction task

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 13: Advanced ETL Techniques & Automation**
- Topics: CDC, triggers, event scheduler  
- Practice:
  - Write a trigger to log updates on sales table
  - Automate daily aggregation with MySQL event scheduler

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 14: Real-World Analytics & Reporting**
- Topics: Complex queries, dynamic SQL  
- Practice:
  - Write a report showing monthly sales by product and region
  - Use conditional aggregation for status-wise counts

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 15: Capstone Project**
- Task:
  - Build an end-to-end SQL-based pipeline
  - Ingest ‚Üí Clean/Transform ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Report
  - Optimize with indexing and query tuning

---

## üîç Deep Dive Days

### ‚úÖ **Day 16: MySQL Cluster & Replication**
- Topics: Master-slave replication, failover setup  
- Practice:
  - Simulate replication in dev environment
  - Query from replica database

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 17: Advanced Security & Auditing**
- Topics: Roles, SSL, encryption, audit logs  
- Practice:
  - Create roles and assign privileges
  - Enable and use audit logs

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 18: MySQL with Big Data Ecosystems**
- Topics: Hive, Spark, Kafka integrations  
- Practice:
  - Connect MySQL to Spark via JDBC
  - Export MySQL data to Hive-compatible format

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 19: Advanced JSON & Spatial Data**
- Topics: JSON functions, spatial indexes  
- Practice:
  - Parse nested JSON arrays
  - Store and query spatial data like coordinates

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 20: Latest MySQL 8+ Features**
- Topics: CTEs, window function improvements, invisible indexes  
- Practice:
  - Rewrite complex queries using CTEs
  - Experiment with invisible indexes
